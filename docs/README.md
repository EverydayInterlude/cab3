Hi Alex,

We should probably walk through how I've put this together, since it isn't particuarly organized right now. Just fyi, the website is being generated off of the gh-pages branch (not the master), and the doc folder in the master branch is doing nothing now. Except for holding this readme...

To add a blog entry or edit or add a page should be pretty simple from here on out. I hope...
